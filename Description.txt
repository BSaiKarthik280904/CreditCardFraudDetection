This project focuses on credit card fraud detection using Logistic Regression, a binary classification model. The dataset (creditcard.csv) is highly imbalanced, with a significantly lower number of fraudulent transactions compared to normal ones. To address this, under-sampling is applied by selecting a subset of legitimate transactions to balance the dataset. The data is then split into training and testing sets, and feature scaling is performed using StandardScaler to improve model performance. The Logistic Regression model is trained on the processed data with class_weight='balanced' to handle the class imbalance. Finally, the model's accuracy is evaluated on both training and test sets using the accuracy_score metric. The goal of the project is to detect fraudulent transactions accurately while dealing with imbalanced data, making it a practical application of machine learning in financial security.
